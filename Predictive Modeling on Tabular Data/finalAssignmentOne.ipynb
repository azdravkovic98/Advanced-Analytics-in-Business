    "Here we start assignment 1 of the course.  Our goal is to identify the most likely customers who will leave the bank.  This is done using a variety of features that include information about the accounts of customers and their balances, as well as the activity of their accounts and any loans they may have with the bank and background information on the customer (education, family, etc.).  This data is also provided for the trailing three months so that changes in patterns can be observed."

    "Due to the limited resources of the bank, the 250 clients that are predicted as most likely to churn will be contacted by the bank in an attempt to retain them.  This means that our goal is not to effectively predict which customers will not churn as it is to find which customers will churn.  Being at a large bank, customers will leave every month.  However, we need to make sure the staff's time is used most effectively which means not wasting their time with customers who will not leave.  This means that a measure like accuracy or AUC would not be appropriate.  Instead, we should count the number of true positives in the top 250.  This can be done using precision."

    "Immediately we can see many binary variables describing the customer's relationship with the bank.  These will be very useful not on their own but when combined with trailing data.  For example, if a customer was very active and then stopped using the account, this is a bad sign.  Also if a customer has recently paid off a loan or cancelled insurance, they may be preparing to leave.\n",

    "# Baris insert info about balances here\n",
    "\n",
    "Other variables have a different story to tell.  For example, the variables, 'customer_since_bank' is given as a year and month.  This information is very useful as a customer who has been with the bank for significant time is less likely to leave.  However, this needs to be converted to time as customer in either months or years to allow an easier interpretation of this decaying likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have another set of variables that need to be featurized in another way.  These are categorical variables where some are ordinal and some are not.  For example, occupation codes are not ordinal.  However, some are certainly more likely to churn than others.  This is true of categories such as customer children as well.  We also have some information on the customer's education level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have information on the customer's postal codes.  This poses an interesting challenge as some postal codes appear to have a much higher likelihood of churning than others.  However, some post codes have so few customers that it is not completely reliable and creates a very high dimensional problem as there are many post codes in Belgium.  Fortunately, these 4 digit numbers make up larger areas so we are able to easily aggregate these codes into larger areas by only using the first two numbers.  For a visualization of this, see the map of 2 digit postal codes below.\n",

We had 39 true positives on the validation set so while we did have some degradation in performance, it was acceptable.  We were very careful to not continuously submit models to the test set but we instead performed tuning and different approaches on the validation set.  This is why we saw a similar performance.\n",

Our recommendation would be that the bank perform a cost benefit analysis to evaluate if the additional resources required to contact 150 more people is worth the payoff of finding the extra people.  This could be done through a breakeven analysis of what is an acceptable true positive rate and then finding a good threshold."
